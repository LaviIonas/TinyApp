## Greeting all internet users

It seems you have been snooping in my personal repositories again, but since you are here, let me show you around.

### To get started, you want to `clone` the project

Then once you have that done, ``npm install`` to download all the dependencies
This includes:
-Express
-EJS
-Cookie-Parser
-Cookie-Session
-Body-Parser
-Bcrypt

To start up the webserver, type into the terminal `npm start` 

Traverse into `localhost:3000` to begin your journey on saving 10 seconds on links
1. Create a new *user*
2. Click the log in button (`no_shit.jpeg`)
3. Either access already existing links... or... **create your own!**
4. When you are done remember to log out or all of your files will be compromised by those your trust the most

Thank you for using my app!!
